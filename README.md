# Heedless DB

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tchajed/heedless-db.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tchajed/heedless-db)

A simple, persistent key-value store implemented in Haskell. This is a prototype for a verified version, along the same lines as [specious-db](https://github.com/tchajed/specious-db), but implemented in Haskell to more closely resemble our shallow embedding and extraction approach for getting runnable code.

The goal is to implement the same functionality as specious-db and benchmark to identify whether Haskell performance is acceptable and what we need to do to ensure that.
